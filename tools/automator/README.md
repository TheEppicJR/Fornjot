# `automator`

CLI tool that automates Fornjot development tasks (mostly release automation).

## Usage

Install `automator`, so you can use it in other repositories (most relevantly, the [website repository](https://github.com/hannobraun/www.fornjot.app)):

``` sh
cargo install --path tools/automator/
```

To learn how to use it, run the following command:

``` sh
automator --help
```

Please also refer to the [release procedure](../../RELEASES.md), which is the main use case for `automator`, as of this writing.
